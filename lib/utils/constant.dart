  <p>The correct combination of weapons is essential to win a match. During the match's initial phase, a player is always recommended to have one close-range (like an MP40) and one long-range weapon (Sniper Rifles or ARs) to sneak kill enemies or snipe them down.</p>
  <p>For the last zones, it will be better if players carry a Shotgun and another SMG or AR. These are the best choices for the last zone fights as they are smaller and require destructive weapons over close proximity.</p>
